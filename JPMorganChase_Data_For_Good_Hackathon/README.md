# Mentor–Student Matching AI (JPMorgan Chase x Charity Hackathon)

This project was developed during the JPMorgan Chase “Data for Good” Hackathon to improve mentor–student pairing for a charity using data science and machine learning.

### Overview
- Built a Random Forest model to predict engagement success between mentors and students.
- Cleaned and merged multiple datasets, handling missing data and encoding text fields using Transformers.
- Produced clustering insights on workfield similarity and prototype recommendations for automation.
- Presented results to JPMorgan’s Data Science team and the partner charity.

### Tools
`Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `transformers`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `JupyterLab`
